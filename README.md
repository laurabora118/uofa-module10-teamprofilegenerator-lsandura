Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: Team Profile Generator Bootcamp Module completed by Laura Sandura

Main Objective: 
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

Challenge: 
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

Additional Expectations:
    recommended to consider adding validation for user input
    // assignment tips noted in lesson 10
    // It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like this:
    // ├── __tests__/             //jest tests
    // │   ├── Employee.test.js
    // │   ├── Engineer.test.js
    // │   ├── Intern.test.js
    // │   └── Manager.test.js
    // ├── dist/                  // rendered output (HTML) and CSS style sheet      
    // ├── lib/                   // classes
    // ├── src/                   // template helper code 
    // ├── .gitignore             // indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
    // ├── index.js               // runs the application
    // └── package.json
